# Upgrading Teleporter 

This document outlines the high-level steps necessary to upgrade Teleporter as a subnet operator, a relayer operator, and a dApp admin. As a reference, the [Teleporter Registry test suite](../../../../tests/flows/teleporter_registry.go) implements the steps described in a test environment.

## Register a New Teleporter Version

Once a new Teleporter contract instance is [deployed](../../../../utils/contract-deployment/README.md), the `addProtocolVersion` method of [TeleporterRegistry.sol](./TeleporterRegistry.sol) must be called. This method is only callable if the associated Warp message was sent via an off-chain Warp message, which is provided by a validator's chain config.

The steps to do so are as follows:

1. Construct the unsigned Warp message bytes:

    a. Pack the Warp payload to be parsed by `addProtocolVersion`. This is a tuple of `(ProtocolRegistryEntry, address)`, where the `ProtocolRegistryEntry` specifies the new `TeleporterMessenger` contract address and the version, and the `address` specifies the `TeleporterRegistry` contract address that the new Teleporter version will be registered with.

    b. Pack the Warp payload as an [AddressedCall](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/blob/v1.11.3/vms/platformvm/warp/payload/addressed_call.go#L15), with the source address set to the zero address. This is how `addProtocolVersion` identifies this message as an off-chain Warp message.
    
    c. Pack the `AddressedCall` message into an [unsigned Warp message](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/blob/v1.11.3/vms/platformvm/warp/unsigned_message.go#L14), specifying the blockchain ID that `TeleporterRegistry` and the new `TeleporterMessenger` are deployed to.

2. Populate the "warp-off-chain-messages" field of each validator node's chain config with the hex-encoded unsigned Warp message bytes. 

3. Restart the node to mark the off-chain Warp message as eligible for signing by the validator.

To actually register the new Teleporter version with the registry, the validators must be queried for their signature of the message, the signatures aggregated, and a signed Warp message created to be included in the transaction that calls `addProtocolVersion`. As an example, [AWM Relayer](https://github.com/ava-labs/awm-relayer) provides this functionality. The following steps illustrate how to use AWM Relayer to register the new Teleporter version.

1. Construct a "manual-warp-messages" entry in the AWM Relayer configuration file, using the following values:

    a. "unsigned-message-bytes": the hex-encoded unsigned Warp message bytes derived above.

    b. "source-blockchain-id": the blockchain ID that that `TeleporterRegistry` and the new `TeleporterMessenger` are deployed to.

    c. "destination-blockchain-id": the blockchain ID that that `TeleporterRegistry` and the new `TeleporterMessenger` are deployed to.

    d. "source-address": the zero address, "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000". This is the "source" address for off-chain Warp messages.

2. Add the `TeleporterRegistry` as a supported message type by adding the following entry to the list of "message-contracts":

    a. Set the key to the zero address, "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000".
    
    b. Set the value as the following, populating the <TELEPORTER_REGISTRY_ADDRESS>:
    ```json
    {
        "message-format": "off-chain-registry",
        "settings": {
            "teleporter-registry-address": "<TELEPORTER_REGISTRY_ADDRESS>"
        }
    }
    ```

3. Restart the relayer. On startup, it will query the validator nodes for their BLS signatures on the off-chain Warp message, construct an aggregate signature and signed Warp message, and use it to call `addProtocolVersion` in the registry.

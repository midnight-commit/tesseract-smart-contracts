## ABI Bindings

This directory contains ABI bindings for the Solidity contracts in the `contracts/src/CrossChainApplications` and `contracts/src/Teleporter` directories. The files with the same name as the Solidity source files are automatically generated by the `scripts/abi_bindings.sh` script. Other files in this directory (such as the packing utilities) are manually created and maintained.
